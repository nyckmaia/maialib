# musicxmlTestSuite

This is a fork of Lilypond's extensive MusicXML test suite
developed for testing the `musicxml2ly` program.  Since it is
useful for lots of music projects that want to support MusicXML,
Michael Scott Asato Cuthbert forked it here with Reinhold Kainhofer's blessing.

In 2026, Michael generously donated it to the
[W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/)
for ongoing stewardship. This test suite [is currently used by the main MusicXML
repository](https://github.com/w3c-cg/musicxml/tree/gh-pages/tests) to validate
the XSD schemas and exercise various other validations.
